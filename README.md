The Movie Hub project is a dynamic movie website that showcases a collection of movies with details such as title, description, image (poster), and release date. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key Features:
HTML: Defines the structure of the website, including the header, movie cards, and footer. The movie data (title, description, etc.) is dynamically populated via JavaScript.
CSS: Provides styling for the website, including layout, card design, and responsive behavior. Flexbox is used for responsive movie card layout, ensuring a clean and modern design.
JavaScript: Handles dynamic data rendering by creating and appending movie cards with information from an array of movie objects. It also allows easy updates to the movie collection.
